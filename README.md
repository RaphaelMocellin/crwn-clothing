# Crwn-clothing

Crwn-clothing is a simple react app i've made using Context API. Its main goal was to pratice React, CONTEXT and Authentication with firebase.
I've managed to build a e-commerce app that shows items using Context API as a global state manager and even has a login feature that uses firebase for authentication.
